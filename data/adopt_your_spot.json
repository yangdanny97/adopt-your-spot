We didn't qualify for a trash bin because we are not a commercial location but we did just plant a tree in one of the empty tree pits, its a Silver Maple from NY Restoration Project and it was free and we have CHI from New Settlement help us plant it and requested another one for the empty tree pit and 311 said they will work on it. We want to give back by putting in work and keeping track of our progress. First Pitch is a competition and only 3 out of 10 teams win and then we will be able to get the prize- the prize is being assigned to a muralist and making a mural outside of our program space. Redoing it and upgrading it with our ideas related to BITTER LITTER and how to make the community around us BETTER!"

We didn't qualify for a trash bin because we are not a commercial location but we did just plant a tree in one of the empty tree pits, its a Silver Maple from NY Restoration Project and it was free and we have CHI from New Settlement help us plant it and requested another one for the empty tree pit and 311 said they will work on it. We want to give back by putting in work and keeping track of our progress. First Pitch is a competition and only 3 out of 10 teams win and then we will be able to get the prize- the prize is being assigned to a muralist and making a mural outside of our program space. Redoing it and upgrading it with our ideas related to BITTER LITTER and how to make the community around us BETTER!"

There are discarded on the steps, on the side (particularly one side) and the weeds have grown so much that half of one side rail is unusable--one really has to stretch the arm out to reach it because of tall weeds. I have made numerous complaints to 311, both by phone and online, and contacted the local community board. Apparently DSNY is responsible for the steps, and DOT, for the side.

However, there is also a specific spot in the block, closer to 28th, (at the general address given above) where the Amtrak train tracks cross over the street. Garbage piles up over time, but it seems to have recently been professionally cleaned (trash picked up, sidewalks scraped, etc.) I'm wondering if you have any idea/involvement with what is going on there? Does the city come out to clean specific problem spots on a schedule, or is something that a resident can make a request to the city about?",
